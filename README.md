## code
* Code is divided into steps:
     * blocks
     * Lines
     * Walls
Ordered according to priority from top to bottom

### Blocks:

We used a simple searching algorithm where the camera searches in a specified ROI (region of interest) which detects the red and green blocks and orders the servo motor to rotate depending on the block's color

### Lines :

In the lines, it was a little different from the blocks. We made a function on the first color the robot detects whether it's orange or blue, and the robot turns and cancels the second line. If the first line the robot sees is orange it turns right and when it sees blue it turns left

### Walls:

the walls it was pretty simple as the camera sees the walls on both sides with no problem in their color values as they have high contrast black color. the robot finds the two walls and calculates their area and then finds the biggest area then goes to the opposite side according to the closer wall then makes the decision to go left or right or forward
