For communicating with the camera module and giving signals to the motor driver to make the
motors move accordingly we use the Arduino nano because of its small size and has many pins.
• We use the motor driver (L298N) to control the speed and direction of motor.
• We use a micro-geared servo motor for the steering by controlling the direction of the forward
wheels to the left or right.
• We use the buck converter to step down the voltage that the battery provides because the
servo motor operates with 5v, not 12v
• We used a 12v DC geared motor because it operates with 12volt and 1 A and provides the robot
with the speed and torque we looking for (250rpm 8kg).
• we used a standard 12volt battery with 3600mA
