## Electrical schematic of our robot

## code
* Code is divided into steps:
     * blocks
     * Lines
     * Walls
Ordered according to priority from top to bottom

### Blocks:

We used a simple searching algorithm where camera search in a specified ROI (region of interest) which detects the red and green blocks and orders the srvo motor to rotate depending on the block's colour

### Lines :

In the lines, it was a little different from the blocks. We made a function on the first colour the robots detects whether it's orange or blue the robot turns and cancel the second line. If the first line the robot sees is orange it turns right and when seeing blue it turns left

### Walls:

the walls it was pretty simple as the camera sees the walls on both sides with no problem in their colour values as they have high contrast black colour. the robot finds the two walls and calculates their area and then finds the biggest area  then go to the opposite side according to the closer wall then make the decision to go left or right or forward
